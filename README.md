# nodemailer

This is an app where you simply use node and nodemailer.

I was trying this for the first time and hence I used handlebars as my view.

The key.email and key.secretKey that you see are the gmail that you are going to use to recieve the messages, and the password needed for that email.

Be sure to set a dotenv file and add it to your .gitignore or a file that is added to the gitignore file in order to protect your information.
